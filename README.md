## Introduction
As a learning exercise, to really hone my skills, I wanted to write a programming language myself. In order to accomplish this, I'm following the amazing tutorial called [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

While Robert goes through the entire process, step-by-step, to create a programming language he calls Lox, I didn't want to simply follow a tutorial and copy-paste code. I have found that real learning occurs when you change up tutorials a little so that you can have a deeper understanding.

In order to do this, I decided to create my own syntax for the language with the same general features as Lox. I also decided to use Rust to make the language instead of Java so that I cannot possibly copy-paste code.
